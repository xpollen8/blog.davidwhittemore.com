# Anne Whittemore
<b>1963-10-27 -> 2024-10-09</b>

I only found out today - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Wilde">by reading about it on Wikipedia(!)</a> - that my cousin, Anne Whittemore, had died last year.

This is a trippy double exposure of me and my cousin on the 700 West farm
in spring of 1970.

# Family

Over the course of nearly 2 decades, my grandmother birthed six boys and (finally!) one girl.

My father was the eldest, and my cousin Anne's father, Paul, was the
second eldest.

My uncle Paul was always "edgy", sarcastic, whip smart, handsome.  Paul's wife died
young of cancer.

When Anne was a teen, both of her younger brothers were killed while riding a moped - hit by a drunk driver. 
For decades afterwards, Paul lived alone, drinking away his early retirement.
I only saw him at rare family gatherings and at the funerals of his parents.

In the late 2010's, Paul would finally die - alone, impoverished, unrecognizable with dementia.

For reasons not explained to me, Anne refered to Paul as her "bio dad",
and kept her distance.  This distance grew to include the rest of the extended family.
While she and I occasionally traded letters, and later a few emails, we (in the family tradition) were in no way "close".  I would characterize it as that we had the typical Whittemore family understanding: you're doing your thing - that's cool!

Anne would spend her professional career far from her Midwestern birthplace, and her last decades
were spent far down in southern Florida.

# Career

Anne was a Whittemore in the truest sense: we tend to set our own sails and follow
our own paths, absurd and interesting, intense and focussed.  The opinions of
would-be detractors serve as fuel to continue on against criticism.

The Wikipedia page cover her radio career in depth, but in summary: Anne had
a good 20 year run as a "shock jock" radio presence, known as "Liz Wilde"

Typical of rememberences:

<blockquote>
On Wednesday, October 9, the radio industry lost one of its most captivating voices, Liz Wilde, who passed away of natural causes. Her groundbreaking contributions, unmatched wit, and bold presence left an indelible mark on rock radio and the countless fans who followed her career.

Often referred to as “the female Howard Stern,” Liz Wilde was unapologetically original and fiercely influential long before “influencer” became a buzzword. She moved in legendary circles, on a first-name basis with the likes of Gene Simmons, Lenny Kravitz, Paris Hilton, and many more, yet never lost her down-to-earth charm.
</blockquote>

# Post-Liz

Anne eventually married, but never had children.  Her husband was also in radio, and they
opened an art gallery.  I never met him.

In reading Anne's obituary, I discovered that her husband Lee Firestone had met his own end just a year before Anne - in an industrial accident.

Had I known what she was going through, had she shared with anyone, we would have reached out.  We Whittemores are not without empathy.  We're just horrible in asking for it.

This little remembrance is an attempt to cement *something* about her life before domains expire and traces of what she was cease to exist.

I'm sorry we were not able to be closer, cousin.  I hope to be more present for those who remain.
